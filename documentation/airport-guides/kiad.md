# Potomac Consolidated TRACON

### About this facility
The Potomac Consolidated Terminal Radar Approach Control is a FAA air traffic control facility which provides radar services to the Washington D.C. and Special Fight Rules Area. The PCT is a combination of four TRACON facilities for the regionâ€™s four major airports: Washington Dulles (IAD), Washington National (DCA), Baltimore-Washington (BWI) and Richmond (RIC).

Washington Dulles International Airport is an international airport 26 miles west of downtown Washington. Dulles handles 90% of all international traffic within the Baltimore-Washington region, with 67,000+ passengers passing through its airport daily with routes to/from 116 destinations (<a href="https://www.mwaa.com/sites/default/files/12-19_ats_2.10.20.pdf" target="_blank">December 2019</a>)

Dulles is a hub for United Airlines.

### Airspace: Shenandoah Area (SHD)
The Shenandoah Area is the part of the Potomac PCT which mainly covers IAD in addition to KFDK and KHEF. The airspace is relatively large, so <a href="https://i.ibb.co/bQSXRmW/image.png" target="_blank">here is a diagram</a> of the airspace that MTV owns.
