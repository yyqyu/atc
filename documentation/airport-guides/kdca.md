# Potomac Consolidated TRACON

### About this facility
The Potomac Consolidated Terminal Radar Approach Control is a FAA air traffic control facility which provides radar services to the Washington D.C. and Special Fight Rules Area. The PCT is a combination of four TRACON facilities for the regionâ€™s four major airports: Washington Dulles (IAD), Washington National (DCA), Baltimore-Washington (BWI) and Richmond (RIC).

Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is an airport just 3 miles south of downtown Washington. It covers 861 hectares, acting as a fortress hub for American Airlines.

In an effort to send more air traffic to the larger Washington Dulles Airport, flights in and out of the airport must not exceed 1,250 statute miles in any direction. There are a few exemptions issued by The US Department of Transportation.

There are no international routes from DCA; the only international flights that go to DCA are business jets that must depart from US Customs and Border Protection pre-clearance facilities.

The airport is known by many pilots for its River Visual procedure for runway 19 which requires at least 3 statute miles of visibility. It uses the Potomac River and various bridges including the Roosevelt Bridge, Memorial Bridge, Rochambeau Bridge and more.

As of <a href="https://www.mwaa.com/sites/default/files/12-19_ats_2.10.20.pdf" target="_blank">December 2019</a>, DCA has 579 daily departures via 17 airlines to 87 unique destinations.

### Airspace: Mount Vernon Area (MTV)
The Mount Vernon Area is the part of the Potomac PCT which mainly covers DCA. The airspace is relatively large, so <a href="https://image.prntscr.com/image/fRaW9wieSJ_Ibi9KRix4Kg.png" target="_blank">here is a diagram</a> of the airspace Mount Vernon owns.

### Airports of Interest

#### KDCA/DCA - Washington Dulles International Airport (Primary Airport)
More information above under *About this facility*.

Mount Vernon (MTV) covers Washington National and certain other minor airports in the area.

#### KIAD/IAD - Washington Dulles International Airport
IAD is an international airport 26 miles west of downtown Washington. Dulles handles 90% of all international traffic within the Baltimore-Washington region, with 67,000+ passengers passing through its airport daily with routes to/from 116 destinations (<a href="https://www.mwaa.com/sites/default/files/12-19_ats_2.10.20.pdf" target="_blank">December 2019</a>)

#### KBWI/BWI - Baltimore-Washington International Airport
Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport is 9 miles south of downtown Baltimore and 32 miles northeast of Washington. BWI handles the most passengers out of all the three major airports within the Baltimore-Washington area. The airport handled 248,585 aircraft movements in 2015-2016; the majority of those flights being operated by Southwest Airlines, which has a fortress hub here.

Chesapeake (CHP) covers Baltimore and the northern area of the PCT.

#### KRIC/RIC - Richmond International Airport
Richmond International Airport is the smallest of the four major airports within the Potomac Consolidated TRACON, 7 miles southeast of downtown Richmond. During 2015-2016 it handled 3,818,759 passengers across 10,073 aircraft movements.

James River (JRV) covers Richmond and the southern area of the PCT.

### Instrument Procedures
The instrument procedures are as of AIRAC 2007.

DCA has very strict noise restrictions, however security is the number one priority. The areas around the National Mall and US Naval Observatory are both prohibited airspace with a ceiling of 18,000ft. This means that aircraft departing to the North must climb quickly and sharply turn left.

##### Departures
DCA has various instrument departures which are all available for usage in openScope. The only departure which is not assigned automatically is the National Seven (NATNL7) departure as it is used much less frequently than the others.

##### Arrivals
There are 9 Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs) into Washington National.

Pilots are expected to descend to meet certain altitude and speed restrictions when they are cleared to "descend via the STAR".

Unfortunately it isn't possible to simulate the RIVER 3 approach for runway 19; runway 01 is preferred for departure and arrival in openScope.

It's also worth looking at fix names for a few of the STARs such as the FRDMM#, NUMMY# and TRUPS# arrivals which were introduced to honour those who died in the September 11th attacks.

CLIPR#
DEALE#
FRDMM#
IRONS#
