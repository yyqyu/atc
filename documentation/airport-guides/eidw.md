# EIDW - Dublin Airport

## About EIDW
Dublin Airport (IATA: DUB, ICAO: EIDW) is an international airport serving Dublin, the capital of The Republic of Ireland. It is the 13th busiest airport in Europe, and by far the busiest in Ireland.

The airport was initially know as Collinstown Aerodrome when it opened in 1917 as a base for the British Royal Flying Corps. The site was then used as an internment camp during the Irish Civil War and left abandoned until 1937, when work began to convert the field into a civil airport for the newly established civil airline, Aer Lingus. By 1950 Dublin Airport had welcomed a total of 920,000 passengers and featured three new concrete runways, the longest of which (16/34) is still used today, although the other two are still clearly visible from the air. Runway 10R/28L was opened in 1989 and a new runway measuring 3,110 m (10,203 ft) is currently under construction to the north of and parallel to the existing runway 10R/28L.

### Arrivals
Dublin Airport was one of the first airports in the world to adopt a point merge system, minimizing conflicts between departing and arriving aircraft as well as reducing fuel consumption. Once within the point merge arches, aircraft can be given shortcuts or vectors to join the ILS approach. Point merge approaches are used for aircraft landing on runways 28L and 10R. Although all STARs include both altitude and speed restrictions, actual descent clearances are given by ATC.
