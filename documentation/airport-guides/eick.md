### About Shannon
Cork Airport is the second-largest of the three principal international airports in the Republic of Ireland, after Dublin and ahead of Shannon. It is located 6.5km south of Cork city centre in an area known as Farmers Cross. In 2018, Cork Airport handled 2,392,821 passengers. Cork is the state's second-busiest airport in terms of passenger numbers, after Dublin, and fourth busiest on the island of Ireland, after Dublin, Belfast International and Belfast City. 

The airport was officially opened on 16 October 1961, following proving flights four days earlier by Aer Lingus and Cambrian Airways. In its first year the airport handled 10,172 passengers â€“ close to the average number of passengers handled each day at the airport in 2007.

### About the Shannon Area Control Centre
The Shannon Area Control Centre is operated by the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) and controls most of the air traffic over the Republic of Ireland between FL75 and FL245. The centre is located in Ballycasey, County Clare in the West of Ireland. In addition, the centre handles over 90% of all air traffic over the North Atlantic, via Shanwick Oceanic Control.

##### Shannon CTA
An area of 25nm radius around EICK is available for your contol within openScope, this includes the following:

| Name | Lower Limit | Upper Limit | Radius around EICK |
| --- | -- | --- | --- |
| Cork CTR | SFC | 5,000ft | 15nm |
| Shannon CTA (Cork) | 5,000ft | FL245 | 15nm |
| Shannon CTA (Cork) | 2,500ft | FL245 | 20nm |
| Shannon CTA | 3,500ft | FL245 | 25nm |

### Instrument Procedures
Cork has various standard instrument departures and terminal arrival routes.

##### Departures
Cork SIDs are divided into two groups for CAT A/B aircraft (light prop traffic) and CAT C/D aircraft (heavy jet traffic). CAT A/B departures make their initial turn once passing 1,000ft allowing CAT C/D aircraft to depart behind them without delay.
A maximum speed of 250 KIAS should be maintained below FL100. Aircraft should climb to 5,000ft and must not exceed 5,000ft until instructed by ATC, except for aircraft on the KURUM departures where the initial climb is 3,500ft.

| Runway | A/B Suffix | C/D Suffix |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 07 | 1M | 1P |
| 25 | 1K | 1L |
| 16 | 1Q | 1S |
| 34 | 1T | 1N |

##### Arrivals
Aircraft arriving into Cork should expect the following STARs, followed by an ILS/RNP/VOR approach to the respective runway. The arrivals into runways 07 and 25 are for CAT A/B aircraft only.

**Note:** Although this isn't simulated in openScope, aircraft will nearly always need to backtrack RWY16/34 (departures backtrack with RWY34 active, arrivals backtrack with RWY16 active). Cork Approach should ideally aim for a minimum of 10nm separation between aircraft on the apprach, to allow for backtracking if necessary. This distance should also be increased if an aircraft is departing in between two arrivals.

| Runway | Suffix |
| -- | -- |
| 07 | 1F |
| 25 | 1H |
| 16 | 1R |
| 34 | 1G |

### Videomap
Provided with the videomap is a a top down view of the airport's runways, the Shannon CTA, the South West coastline and nearby airfields. Every dash on an extended centreline represents one (1) nautical mile, with each small 'T' representing four (4) miles.

All restricted airspaces are plotted too.
