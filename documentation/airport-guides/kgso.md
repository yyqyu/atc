# KGSO - Piedmont Triad International Airport

## About GSO
The Piedmont Triad Int'l Airport, locally known as "PTI", is a medium sized airport that primarily serves the Triad region of central North Carolina. The primary cities it serves are Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and High Point. This airport is located on the western side of Greensboro, almost halfway to Winston-Salem. In 2019, GSO had just under 160,000 aircraft operations. GSO is currently a small hub for FedEx.

## Airspace
The GSO airspace is fairly large and covers multiple smaller airports in the region from the surface to 12,000 ft in most places. It is bordered to the east by Raleigh TRACON and to the south by Charlotte TRACON.

## Procedures
GSO is served by both of conventional and RNAV departures and arrivals. When the airport is on a southwest flow (as is currently depicted), 23R is typically the departure runway and 23L is used for arrivals. ATC will have aircraft on the TRAKS and BLOCC arrivals cross those fixes, respectively, at 11,000 ft. On the HENBY arrival, aircraft will be cleared to cross HENBY at 12,000 ft. All aircraft must be manually descended from those fixes onward.
